# LiouvilleDMD
This repository contains MATLAB code for dynamic mode decomposition in continuous time using Liouville operators and occupation kernels. The code implements the methods described in
 - https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00332-021-09746-w (Liouville DMD),
 - https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.02646 (Higher order Liouville DMD), and
 - https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.02639 (Provably Convergent Liouville DMD)

Several examples that illustrate the use of the methods are also available in the Examples folder.

Compatibility: MATLAB R2020b or newer.
